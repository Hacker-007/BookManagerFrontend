> Project Features

This project uses Vue.js to create a front-end view. The backend is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that it can be accessed anywhere and at anytime.

When you run the project, you will land on the homepage. There are three tabs on the navigation bar:
- Home
- Sign Up / Log In
- Sign Out

When you click on the Sign Up / Log In tab, you will be presented with a form asking for information. First, click on whether you are a teacher or a student. This will change the values that the form requires. Fill out the form with the respective information.

Once you fill out the information, you will see a new tab on the navigation bar called "Manage". Once you click on this tab, you will be presented with information that relates with each role.

As a teacher, you can add a new student to your class and add books to the available books.
As a student, you can checkout books.
